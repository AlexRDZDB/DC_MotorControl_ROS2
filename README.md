# DC Motor Velocity Controller with ROS2

This project provides a ROS2-based framework for controlling the rotational velocity of a JGA25-371 DC motor using a closed-loop PID controller. The system integrates an ESP32 microcontroller with ROS2 via the Micro-ROS library to create a responsive and modular control system suitable for embedded robotics applications.

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

- **Microcontroller Communication**: Interface an ESP32 with a host computer running ROS2 using the [Micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/) library.
- **Velocity Measurement**: Calculate the motor's rotational velocity from quadrature encoder data on the ESP32.
- **ROS2 Integration**: Stream encoder-based velocity data to ROS2 topics for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Closed-Loop Control**: Implement a PID controller in ROS2 that adjusts motor speed to match a specified setpoint.
- **Waveform Testing**: Evaluate controller response to step, sine, and square wave input profiles.

## ðŸ“¦ Package Description

### `control_node`

This ROS2 node implements a PID controller for velocity regulation. It performs the following tasks:

- **Subscriptions**:
  - `/motor_output` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32`): Receives the current motor velocity as computed by the ESP32.
  - `/set_point` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32`): Receives the desired target velocity.

- **Publication**:
  - `/pwm` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32`): Publishes a normalized PWM command between `-1.0` and `1.0`, where the sign indicates direction and the magnitude represents speed. A value of `0.0` corresponds to zero velocity.

- **PID Control**:
  - The PID gains are configurable via ROS2 parameters.
  - The control output is bounded to prevent integral windup and excessive actuation.

### `input_node`

This ROS2 node generates dynamic setpoints for testing controller performance. It supports the following input profiles:

- **Step Function**
- **Sine Wave**
- **Square Wave**

- **Publication**:
  - `/set_point` (`std_msgs/msg/Float32`): Publishes the desired velocity setpoint.

- **Configuration**:
  - Setpoint type, amplitude, frequency, and update rate can be modified using ROS2 parameters.
